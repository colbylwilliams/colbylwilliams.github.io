excerpt: This video shows how you can use multiple <code>.storyboards</code> in your Xamarin.iOS (or just iOS) app, and create segues in Interface Builder directly to another <code>.storyboard</code> just like you would to a <code>UIViewController</code>`.

I notice a lot of iOS developers who still stick to the "one storyboard per app" rule.  Or worse, they avoid using `.storyboards` all-together from fear of merge conflict hell (gross).

**Multiple `.storyboard` files in a single app _is_ a thing, and I'd encourage iOS developers to utilize this pattern more often than not.**

I love Xamarin, but as I've [mentioned](/2016/09/26/default-designer.html) before, I prefer to work with `.xibs` and `.storyboards` in Xcode Interface Builder opposed to Visual Studioâ€™s built-in designer.

This video shows how you can use multiple `.storyboards` in your Xamarin.iOS (or just iOS) app, and create segues in Interface Builder directly to another `.storyboard` just like you would to a `UIViewController`.
